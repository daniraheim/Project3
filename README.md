1.  My name is Danielle Raheim.  This is my Project3.
2.  This project includes a To-Do list tracker.  Upon launching the page, the user can hit "List" to see a generic To-Do List.  The "Add New" button allows users to add new tasks to the list.  The "Contact" buttom lets users into their info to be contacted.  The dropdown menu on the main page allows users to filter between All tasks, Completed tasks, and Unfinished tasks.
3.  With this project, I used React to build an application that tracks and maintains a To-Do List.  New tasks can be added to the list.  The tasks can be edited, marked as completed, unmarked as completed, and/or deleted.
4.  The technologies that were used in the making of this application would include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, and Redux.
5.  Future development plans for this application would be an embedded calendar, a reminder feature for deadlines, and achievement badges when a certain number of tasks are completed within a certain timeframe.
